# Experimenting with reactive and server sent events

Here is a couple of examples or rather, experiments around reactive programming.

I have used Spring Boot Webflux and R2DBC driver with a Postgresql database.

## Observations and learnings

### Server sent event

When setting up a listener for event streams, Chrome seems to be polling. That was not my expectation, I expected it to be a server push technology.

Is it a combination of the server implementation and the browser doing some kind of fall back? 

The JavaScript for to register an ``EventSource``:
```
const evtSource = new EventSource("http://localhost:8080/events");
evtSource.onmessage = function (event) {
    const newElement = document.createElement("li");
    const eventList = document.getElementById("list");

    newElement.innerHTML = "Event data  : " + event.data;
    eventList.appendChild(newElement);
}
```

The server side is using a reactive construction:
```
@GetMapping(produces = MediaType.TEXT_EVENT_STREAM_VALUE)
public Flux<ServerSentEvent<String>> getMessages(@RequestHeader HttpHeaders headers) {
    List<String> lastIds = headers.get("Last-Event-ID");
    String lastId = lastIds == null ? "0" : lastIds.get(0);
    return messageService.getMessages(lastId);
}
```
By using the ``Last-Event-ID`` header attribute the last id the client can communicate which the last id it had received. Without it, all messages would be received again.

### Reactive database

It is not just a replacement of the driver, there are several other things that are different, compared to using Spring JPA.

#### Entity annotation
The class to represents persisted data [MessageEntity](src/main/java/se/artcomputer/edu/sse/MessageEntity.java), do **not** have an `@Entity` annotation.

#### Generating primary id
The `@GeneratedValue` is not available, so I relied on Postgresql to generate a primary key.

#### Implement Persistable
I am not sure about this, but it seems to be important that the entity class ``implements Persistable<Long>``, which simply tells whether to insert or update.

#### Repository interface
Instead of using `JPARepository`, you need to use `ReactiveCrudRepository` which returns `Flux` objects. But the experience is similar in other aspects.

#### Flyway
Flyway does not support R2DBC (there is an issue about it) so I needed to add a section in the application configuration where Flyway gets a JDBC url: 
  ```
    flyway:
        url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/sse
        user: postgres
        password: mysecret
  ```
  It is enough, though, unlike other sources claim.
  
#### Creating many entities
When creating 1000 entities using a reactive construction, the order of the creation is not sequential, which I think is cool. 

Here is the construction for creating entities and returning the data transfer object `Message`:
```
public Flux<Message> generate() {
    return Flux.range(0, 1000).flatMap(this::create);
}

private Mono<Message> create(Integer n) {
    MessageEntity entity = new MessageEntity();
    entity.setMessage("This is generated " + n);
    return messageRepository.save(entity).map(this::toDto);
}
```
As you can see, the messages are numbered and as said, the order of them are not they same in the database. This is evident from the primary key that is generated by Postgresql. Eg:

|id |message
|---|-------
|9 |This is generated 7
|10|This is generated 12
|11|This is generated 13
|12|This is generated 14
|13|This is generated 9
|14|This is generated 10
Cool, right?

#### Reading many entities

I would like to see the entites come trickling when querying for 1000 entities at once but they came all in one bunch. So I need to study this more.
